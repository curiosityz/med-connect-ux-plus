Purpose: Stores mailing and practice location addresses and phone numbers for providers.
Columns:
npi (BIGINT)
provider_first_line_business_mailing_address (TEXT)

(Optional columns if USPS/Smarty cleaning is implemented later: cleaned_*, latitude, longitude, dpv_match_code, last_cleaned_date)
Primary Key: npi (assuming one address record per NPI in the source file).
Foreign Keys: npi originally referenced npi_details(npi). This constraint was DROPPED during import due to NPIs existing in the address file but not the details file.
Indexes: Primary key index, npi_addresses_practice_zip_idx (BTREE on provider_business_practice_location_address_postal_code).
Notes: Source was prescriber-address-phone-data CSV. Contains orphaned NPI records. Address data quality varies; may contain abbreviations (e.g., "PHILA") or ZIP+4.
4. Table: npi_prescriptions
Purpose: Stores aggregated prescription claim counts for specific drugs by provider, within the context of a specific state's dataset.
Columns:
prescription_id (SERIAL): Auto-incrementing primary key.
npi (BIGINT)
drug_name (TEXT): Often the brand name or specific formulation.
generic_name (TEXT): The generic drug name (e.g., "ALPRAZOLAM"). Used for searching.
total_claim_count (INTEGER): Number of claims for this NPI/Drug/State combination.
state (VARCHAR(2)): The 2-letter state abbreviation corresponding to the source data file (e.g., 'PA', 'AK'). Added during import.
Primary Key: prescription_id.
Foreign Keys: npi originally referenced npi_details(npi). This constraint was DROPPED during import due to NPIs existing in the prescription files but not the details file.
Indexes: Primary key index, npi_prescriptions_npi_idx, npi_prescriptions_generic_name_idx (BTREE on lower(generic_name)), npi_prescriptions_state_idx.
Notes: Data aggregated from multiple state-specific CSV files (e.g., ALSHORT.csv). Contains orphaned NPI records.
5. Table: app_users
Purpose: Stores application-specific data for users authenticated via Supabase, linking them by their Supabase User ID. Resides in the rx database.
Columns:
supabase_user_id (UUID): The user's unique ID from Supabase Auth (auth.users.id).
email (TEXT): Optional, potentially synced from Supabase.
membership_tier (VARCHAR(10)): 'basic', 'premium', or 'expert'. Used to determine search capabilities.
created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
updated_at (TIMESTAMPTZ): Automatically updated by a trigger.
Primary Key: supabase_user_id.
Foreign Keys: None outgoing. Referenced by user_locations.
Indexes: Primary key index.
Notes: Requires the uuid-ossp extension. This table needs to be populated (likely via backend logic/webhook) when a user signs up through Supabase.
6. Table: user_locations
Purpose: Stores named locations (with zip codes) saved by users, primarily for Premium/Basic tier searches. Resides in the rx database.
Columns:
user_location_id (SERIAL): Auto-incrementing primary key.
supabase_user_id (UUID): Links to the app_users table.
location_name (TEXT): User-defined name (e.g., "Home", "Work").
zip_code (VARCHAR(10)): The zip code for this location.
is_primary (BOOLEAN): Indicates the default location for Basic users.
created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
Primary Key: user_location_id.
Foreign Keys: supabase_user_id REFERENCES app_users(supabase_user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE.
Indexes: Primary key index, idx_user_locations_supabase_user_id.
Notes: Backend queries this table based on supabase_user_id to find the appropriate zip_code for Basic/Premium searches. Needs API endpoints for users to manage these.
7. Table: npi_addresses_usps (Created, but currently unused)
Purpose: Intended to store results from calling the USPS Address Standardization API.
Columns: npi (BIGINT PK), usps_firm, usps_street_address, usps_secondary_address, usps_city, usps_state_abbr, usps_zip5, usps_zip4, usps_urbanization, usps_return_text, usps_error_number, usps_processed_at.
Notes: This table exists but contains no data, as the USPS API integration script was skipped. It could be populated later if address cleaning via USPS is pursued.
