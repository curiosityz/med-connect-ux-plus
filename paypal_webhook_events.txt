Webhook Events to subscribe to in your PayPal Developer Dashboard:

1. PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED
   - Triggered when a payment capture initiated by your application is successfully completed.
   - Your webhook endpoint at https://rxprescribers.com/api/paypal/webhook uses this to finalize the user's purchase, update their payment status to 'completed' in the database, and update their Clerk publicMetadata with plan details.

2. PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED
   - Triggered when a payment capture is denied by PayPal (e.g., due to risk assessment, regulatory reasons).
   - Your webhook endpoint at https://rxprescribers.com/api/paypal/webhook uses this to record the payment attempt as 'denied' in the database and potentially update Clerk publicMetadata to reflect the failed payment attempt.

3. PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DECLINED
   - Triggered when a payment capture is declined by the processor or customer's bank.
   - Your webhook endpoint at https://rxprescribers.com/api/paypal/webhook handles this similarly to DENIED, marking the payment as 'declined' and updating records accordingly.

4. PAYMENT.CAPTURE.FAILED
   - A general event for when a payment capture fails for other reasons.
   - Your webhook endpoint at https://rxprescribers.com/api/paypal/webhook also processes this to mark the payment as 'failed'.
